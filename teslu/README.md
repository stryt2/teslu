# Teslu Application

This is a private Tesla python application for personal use.

Tesla official app does not support sentry mode scheduling based on geofence, and sentry mode
drains battery pretty quickly if left on all the time.

This lambda function allows me to turn on and off sentry mode based on other things like
EventBridge.
